# CS15 Data Structures Coursework

I took Data Structures at Tufts University during the fall of 2022. In this course I developed, implemented, and rigerously tested various data structures in C++ with a consideration for how my decisions affect the time and space complexity of my implementation. I now am course assistant for this class, where I hold officer hours, assess student work, and work on the course infrastructure. 

Per course policy, this work cannot be made public. If you would like to view my coursework for a coding sample, however, please feel free to reach out thomas.lyons@tufts.edu.
